here I use Jackson Maven Dependencies to create objects of json file and also the json file from objects

here the json file I used is 
{
"id":34,
"name":"Arun",
"companyname":"Rockwell
}

with respect of this I created the java objects and also the vice versa

first i need add the deppendencies - for that i need to copy paste below text in pom.xml

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
       <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
       <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
       <version>2.10.0.pr2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

and then import "ObjectMapper" module from com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.*;
and then create an object for "ObjectMapper" and then using "readValue" function


similary to create  json  from object ,use "writeValueAsString" function

also here need create a class called employee to with parameter(id,name,company name)
and write and get and set functions in that class

this ask I coudn't complete it because and I have problem with add the jacson dependencies in pom.xml file.
I add the deppendency but I can't able to call that in the java class
