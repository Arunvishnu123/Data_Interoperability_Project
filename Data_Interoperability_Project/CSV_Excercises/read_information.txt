Here I open three .csv file in excel and word editor

A CSV (comma-separated values) file is a simple text file in which information is separated by commas.
A tab-separated values (TSV) file is a simple text format for storing data in a tabular structure.

when .csv file open in excel,then it look like in tabular format.So it is very easy to understand and analyse the data
But when .csv file open in a microsoft word,data is just separated by commas.so it is difficult to study the data


Also here I used "CSV" module from python to read some .csv documents
