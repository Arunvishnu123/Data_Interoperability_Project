//here I encode and decode some string and pictures and I attached the screenshot of outputs  


for encode and decode I use "base64"module from Python

to decode image string and convert to .png format(what_is_this task)
        here I used "image" class from PIL library and "BytesIO" class from io library
and "base64" module
